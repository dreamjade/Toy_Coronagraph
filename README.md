# Toy Coronagraph

The toycoronagraph package is implemented in Python

Language | Branch | Note
---------- | -------- | ------
Python | [`python`](https://github.com/abmantz/lrgs/tree/python) | [On PyPI](https://pypi.python.org/pypi/toycoronagraph) (though not always the most recent [version](https://github.com/dreamjade/Toy_Coronagraph/blob/main/toycoronagraph/__init__.py))

for simulating coronagraphs. It is designed to be simple and easy to use, while still providing a powerful and flexible framework for simulating a variety of coronagraph designs. 

The package includes a number of pre-defined coronagraph designs, as well as a library of functions for creating custom coronagraphs. It also includes a number of tools for visualizing the results of simulations, such as ray tracing plots and intensity maps.

The toycoronagraph package is open source and available on GitHub. It is a valuable tool for anyone interested in learning about coronagraphs or simulating the performance of coronagraph designs.
